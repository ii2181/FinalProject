**Scientific Question:
Barium and Salinity concentrations in the global ocean typically show 1:1 correlation.
Is this correlation verified by the available GEOTRACES ocean chemistry data?

**Links to datasets:
Discrete Sample Data - netCDF file â€”> global ocean water trace element (Ba) and Salinity data 
https://www.bodc.ac.uk/geotraces/data/idp2017/

**Analysis plan (3 sentences summary)
Global ocean water concentrations of Salinty and Barium will be plotted separately.
Basin specific concentrations will also be plotted to observe finer scale correlations.
Their correlations and dissimilarities will then be calculated and plotted using cartopy to show whether the 1:1 ratio that is typically assumed between the two variables can be verified.
